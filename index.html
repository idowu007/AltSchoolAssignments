            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>Adeyinka Idowu, 7th child and last born of Mr and Mrs Adeyinka. I grew up with 6 amazing siblings,
                sometimes it feels like I had 9 parents because they always looked after me.
                I have always being in awe of them. Excluding the times they try shifting chores to me tho.
                A graduate of Oduduwa University, majored in Industrial chemistry and finished with a second class upper
                (2:1)
                Still writing the good part of my biography in real time and I am sure Alt school will be part/turning
                point
                in the updated version of my biography to come.

            <h3>Why I Joined AltSchool</h3>
            <p>
                I started ny front-end journey self learning and alone. It was tough and challenging but i was still
                pushing.
                I came across Alt school on twitter now X, I saw reviews from people who had joined and finished the
                programme.
                The structure and community they have built was something I have always longed for, I hope utilize this
                oppurtunity to be a better Front-end Engineer, along with the great Front-end i'll become friends with
                in this journey.
                Thank you.
